# My Personal Diary — HTML & CSS Project

A notebook‑style static website with a mood tracker, archive, dark mode (CSS‑only), and print‑ready styles.

## Structure
- `index.html` — Home + mood tracker + demo New Entry modal
- `archive.html` — Timeline of sample entries with anchor links
- `about.html` — Project overview and features
- `contact.html` — Demo contact form (non‑functional)
- `css/style.css` — Main styles (responsive, dark mode, notebook visuals)
- `css/print.css` — Cleaner print layout (save pages as PDF)
- `images/` — SVG assets (favicon, tape, pin)

## How to Run
Just open `index.html` in your browser. No build tools required.

## Notes
- Interactions (add entry, filters) are mocked using CSS only for demonstration, per HTML/CSS project guidelines.
- You can duplicate `<article class="entry">…</article>` blocks in `archive.html` to add more posts.

## Credits
Fonts from Google Fonts: Inter & Shantell Sans.
Assets are simple SVGs created for this project.
